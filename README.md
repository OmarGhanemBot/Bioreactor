Bioreactor 
=========
This program is used to make a simple task of taking a random *SEQ* of *Nucleic Acid* and Make the magic :-

1-Check IF the SEQ is *RNA* or *DNA*.

2-Give you the Complementary *SEQ*.

3-Count Number of *Total* and *Number of each Nucleotide*.


How To Use:-
=============== 
(1)----> Enter your "SEQ"

(2)----> Enter the direction of your "SEQ" (*)

(3)----> Number of *Total* and *Number of each Nucleotide* 

(4)----> Get Your N' >-Complementary *SEQ* -< N''


(*) In this step you should enter the direction by entring the number of carbon atom of the *Deoxyribose Sugar* or *Ribose Sugar* as following :- 

== *3->5*  ==  OR  ==  *5->3*  == {without "spaces" should have "->"in between}
