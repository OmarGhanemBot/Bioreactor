Bioreactor 
=========
This simple C program that can be used to do a simple task of taking a random *SEQ* of *Nucleic Acid* and Make THIS magic (:D) :-

1-Check IF the SEQ is *RNA* or *DNA*.

2-Give you the Complementary *SEQ*.

3-Count Number of *Total* and *Number of each type of Nucleotides*.


How To Use:-
=============== 
(1)----> Enter your "SEQ"

(2)----> Enter the direction of your "SEQ" (*)

(3)----> Number of *Total* and *Number of each Nucleotide* 

(4)----> Get Your N' >-Complementary *SEQ* -< N''


(*) In this step you should enter the direction by entring the number of carbon atom of the *Deoxyribose Sugar* or *Ribose Sugar* as following :- 

== *3->5*  ==  OR  ==  *5->3*  == {without "spaces" should have "-"in between}

Note:-
======
You have to include cs50 library which you could find it here : https://cs50.readthedocs.io/libraries/cs50/c/
